  # The python orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can use repeatedly in your configuration files
  # Orb commands and jobs help you with common scripting around a language/tool
  # so you dont have to copy and paste it everywhere.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/python
  python: circleci/python@1.2

      # Checkout the code as the first step. This is a dedicated CircleCI step.
      # The python orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a Pipfile via Pipenv by default.
      # Here we're making sure we use just use the system-wide pip. By default it uses the project root's requirements.txt.
      # Then run your tests!
      # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
